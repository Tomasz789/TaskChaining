# TaskChaining

Simple application that demonstrates how the task chaining works. <br />
App runs three consecutive tasks: <br/>

Task 1: Creates an array containing 10 integer elements. <br/>
Task 2: Returns previous array but its elements are multiplied by randomly generated number. <br/>
Task 3: Sorts the array in ascending order. <br/>
Task 4: Finds an average value of items of the array. <br/>
